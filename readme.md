SQLiteQueryBuilder
==================

 

It’s an amazing, free and open source library to get rid of repetitive queries
writing.

 

What it is?
-----------

 

It’s a simple tool to dynamically provide a string for SQLite statements using
the C\# object notation, making **DAL **maintenance pretty easy and avoiding
dangerous `Ctrl + C`, `Ctrl + V` based changes on annoying hell’s strings
concatenations.

 

The library was designed to be basic enough to do the job, but allowing you to
create an elaborated solution according to your projects architecture.

 

### **Targets**

 

The main target is shared projects for mobile solutions, but wherever you have
the need to build SQLite query strings it would fit.

 

### **Features**

 

On the following board, you can see the library’s features:
